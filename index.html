<h1 class="textx">About LM Designs</h1>
  <p class="bio">As someone who always played ERLC in private servers, I was always paranoid about how liveries looked on my vehicles, and the amount of detail on them.</p>
  <br>
  <p class ="bio">Because of this, I decided that I should use my time off other work, to make liveries for private server owners looking for a bargain!</p>
